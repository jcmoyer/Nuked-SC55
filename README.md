# Nuked SC-55

Fork of [nukeykt/Nuked-SC55](https://github.com/nukeykt/Nuked-SC55) with the
goal of extracting the emulator backend so that it can be used in other
programs. This fork aims to be 100% behavior-compatible with upstream
(including bugs). For bugs that occur in both this fork and upstream, do not
open an issue here; report it upstream instead.

Differences from upstream:

- Produces a library for the emulator.
- Standard frontend supports routing to multiple emulators to raise polyphony
  limits.
- Includes a MIDI-to-WAVE rendererer.
- Adds tests so that the backend can be modified without worrying about
  breaking things.
- Command line is handled slightly differently. Pass `--help` to a binary to
  see what arguments it accepts.

## Building

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).

## License

Nuked SC-55 can be distributed and used under the original MAME license (see
LICENSE file). Non-commercial license was chosen to prevent making and selling
SC-55 emulation boxes using (or around) this code, as well as preventing from
using it in the commercial music production.
